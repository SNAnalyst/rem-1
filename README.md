# rem
R-package for relational event models (REM). 

Calculate endogenous network effects in event sequences and fit relational event models (REM). Using network event sequences (where each tie between a sender and a target in a network is time-stamped), REMs can measure how networks form and evolve over time. Endogenous patterns such as popularity effects, inertia, similarities, cycles or triads can be calculated and analyzed over time.
